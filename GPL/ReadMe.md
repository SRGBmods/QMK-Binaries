### Manually add Protocol support files ###

To manually add the SignalRGB Protocol 1.0.4 to almost any qmk fork please see the [following files](https://github.com/SRGBmods/QMK-Binaries/tree/main/GPL/qmk_firmware).

The above code changes have been applied to vanilla / playground repos for each fork(s) for the binaries provided.

* If and when possible specific forks for supporting specific keyboards will be merged to QMK mainline release (cp -rp specificfork/keyboards/<keyboard_brand/maybe_a_child> ~/qmk/mainline/keyboards) and compiled against it. *
_(The above may include backporting RGB_Matrix to that specific board and the source is available in the QMK mainline and can be provided upon request keeping track of all these gets a bit tricky but I will definitely **try**.)_
