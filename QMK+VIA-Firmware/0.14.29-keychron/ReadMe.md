[wls_2025q1](https://github.com/SRGBmods/QMK-Binaries/tree/main/QMK%2BVIA-Firmware/0.14.29-keychron/wls_2025q1) is bleeding edge firmware and may have issues and should be considered as alpha/beta builds. The below builds are suggested for production usage before using these builds.

[wireless_playground](https://github.com/SRGBmods/QMK-Binaries/tree/main/QMK%2BVIA-Firmware/0.14.29-keychron/wireless_playground) is the more recent build but if upon flashing you don't have any luck try the [bluetooth_playground](https://github.com/SRGBmods/QMK-Binaries/tree/main/QMK%2BVIA-Firmware/0.14.29-keychron/bluetooth_playground) build. [playground](https://github.com/SRGBmods/QMK-Binaries/tree/main/QMK%2BVIA-Firmware/0.14.29-keychron/playground) is for more recent wired keyboards that haven't reached mainline yet.

**One thing of note if you are attempting to use VIA to configure your keyboard you _must_ quit SignalRGB before running either software**

To use these files you may find QMK Toolbox helpful:
https://github.com/qmk/qmk_toolbox/releases/
**Make sure to run as Administrator and then go to the Tools menu -> and Install Drivers! (Ctrl+N)**

You will also need to follow [the directions](https://www.keychron.com/pages/firmware) from your Keyboard manufacturer to put it bootloader mode in order to use QMK Toolbox.
