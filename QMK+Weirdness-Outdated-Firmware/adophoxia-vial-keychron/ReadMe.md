## WARNING: These firmware files are massively unsupported / outdated use at your own risk ##

The reason being as they are based upon very old releases of QMK for specific keyboards and may have been abandoned by the original developer.

It is highly recommended that you have an original firmware for your keyboard + understand how to recover your keyboard from a possible brick (not working) state.

If you accept this, feel free to try these firmware files. (Of course as always we recommend VIA builds first!)

# _Make sure to click the download button for your specific firmware, do not save as or view raw!_ #

---

**One thing of note if you are attempting to use VIA to configure your keyboard you _must_ quit SignalRGB before running either software**

To use these files you may find QMK Toolbox helpful:
https://github.com/qmk/qmk_toolbox/releases/

Or if a sonix release:
https://sonixqmk.github.io//SonixDocs/install/#4-flashing-the-firmware

You will also need to follow the directions from your Keyboard manufacturer to put it bootloader mode in order to use QMK Toolbox.
(Check their website for directions, you should honestly check there anyways for firmware in case you to need to factory restore as well.)
