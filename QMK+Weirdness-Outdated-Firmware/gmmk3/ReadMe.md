## WARNING: These firmware files are massively unsupported / outdated use at your own risk ##

The reason being as they are based upon very old releases of QMK for specific keyboards and may have been abandoned by the original developer.

It is highly recommended that you have an original firmware for your keyboard + understand how to recover your keyboard from a possible brick (not working) state.

If you accept this, feel free to try these firmware files. (Of course as always we recommend VIA builds first!)
